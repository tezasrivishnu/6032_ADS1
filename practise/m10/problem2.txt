public void Fact(int number) {
	if(number == 1) {
		return 1;
	}
	return number * Fact(number - 1);
}

when the number is 5, the process takes place as 

Fact(1) = 1
Fact(2) = Fact(1) + 1 = 2
Fact(3) = Fact(2) + 1 = 3
Fact(4) = Fact(3) + 1 = 4
Fact(5) = Fact(4) + 1 = 5

so the time complexity of the factorial is O(N).
