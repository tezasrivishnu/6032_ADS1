stack stack = new Stack();
while(!q.isEmpty())
	stack.push(q.dequeue());
while(!stack.isEmpty())
	q.enqueue(stack.pop());


let us consider for a example for the following
	q = 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8
output at end of the 1st while loop is 
	stack = 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8
output at end of the 2nd while loop is 
	q = 8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1

the whole stack is reversed by this method.
